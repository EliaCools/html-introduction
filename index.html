<h2 class="chapter">A funny story</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>
This year a few days before chrismas my car battery broke down. <br/>
luckily, I was right before my friends driveway, so we could push it to his garage.<br>
We could load up the battery but while driving that evening it broke down again. Halfway home.<br/>
He had ordered a car battery that ended up ariving on christmass evening.<br/>
So we ended up changing the car battery on christmas evening. <br/>
A fitting way to come together on christmas on a year like this.

</p>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>Car battery broke down so my car stalled on a random spot. Ended up changing the car battery on christmas evening with a good friend.
